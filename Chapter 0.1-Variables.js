//To declare a variable in JavaScript, you use the "var" keyword followed by the name of the variable//
var x;
//This declares a variable called "x" but does not assign any value to it. You can also assign a value to a variable when you declare it, like this: //
var x = 10;
//In JavaScript, you can also use the "let" and "const" keywords to declare variables. The "let" keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned later, while the "const" keyword is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned. For example://
let y = 20;
const z = 30;
//In this example, "y" is a variable that can be reassigned, while "z" is a constant that cannot be reassigned.//
//Data Types
//In JavaScript, there are several data types that you can use to store different types of data. Some common data types include:

//Numbers (e.g. 10, 3.14)
//Strings (e.g. "hello", 'world')
//Booleans (e.g. true, false)
//Arrays (e.g. [1, 2, 3])
//Objects (e.g. { name: "John", age: 30 })
